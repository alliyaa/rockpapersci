I learnt some basic javascript for this project, and mainly focused on applying what I learnt so I added minimal html and css. There's a function that randomly generates the computer's choice, one that stores the player's choice using addeventlistener, if user clicks on the rock image the user's choice will be stored as rock (same for paper and scissors). There's a function that takes both the computer and the player's choices and figures out who wins based on set rules, there's a function that keeps score count and displays the winner of the tournament, a function that displays a message for a new game after 5 rounds are over.
